# Roadmap to Become a Machine Learning Expert

I'll recommend learning both Python & R, but if you are only learning one of them, then I would suggest going with Python.

- **Learn Basic Python Syntax:** Basic Arithmetic Operations, Control & Conditional Structures, Looping, User Input, Strings, Integers, Typecasting
- **Learn In-built Data Structures:** List, Set, Tuple, Dictionary, Function, Lambda Function, Iterators & Generators, Exception Handling & Imports Libraries
- **OOPS:** Classes, Object, Method, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Data Abstraction, Encapsulation
- **Libraries with Python:** Numpy, Pandas, Scipy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn**Link:** [Learn Python in 20 Days for Free!](https://www.kaggle.com/questions-and-answers/262250)

### **2. Learn Basic Statistics**

- **Probability Distributions:** Continuous and Discrete
- **Basic Probability:** Independent and Dependent Events, Marginal Probability, Conditional Probability, Joint Probability
- **Measures of Central Tendency:** Mean, Median, Mode
- **Variance, Standard Deviation & Standard Error**

### **3. Learn Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- Identification of variables and data types
- Analyzing the basic metrics
- Non-Graphical & Graphical Univariate Analysis
- Bivariate Analysis
- Variable transformations, Missing value/Outlier Treatment
- Correlation Analysis/Dimensionality Reduction

### **4. Learn Supervised & Unsupervised Model**

### **Supervised Models:**

- Linear/Polynomial/Logistic regression

- Ensemble models like Bagging and Random Forest
- Supervised Vector Machines

### **Unsupervised Models:**

- Clustering
- Association Rule Learning

### **5. Learn Deep Learning Models**
